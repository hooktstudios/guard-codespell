## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - Initial release - 2021-12-04

In this first release, we have a basic implementation of codespell in a guard environment. 

The only available option for this version is to set the path to a [codespell config file](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell#using-a-config-file) for the plugin to set the correct usage of codespell.
